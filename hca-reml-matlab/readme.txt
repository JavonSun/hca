File HcaReml.m has the implementation of the restricted maximum likelihood method for heritable component analysis. This method takes in genetic correlation matrix (GRM) among individuals as genetic inputs. GRM can be estimated using genome-wide genetic markers. Softwares, such as GCTA (a tool for Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis) can be used to estimated GRM for unrelated individuals.

An analysis example with both script and data is provided in the example folder
